        """
        Perform an automatic segmentation of the ventricles of the brain based on histogram properties. The local
        intensity change is calculated at each voxel. The principle behind this technique is that the average local
        local intensity change among voxels in different regions of the histogram is calculated based on a calculation
        of a histogram that is weighted with the local intensity change at each voxel. Subsequently, the intensity with
        the highest local intensity change between WM and CSF is selected as the splitting intensity for the purpose
        of splitting the brain mask. Before the histograms are calculated, the brain mask is first eroded with a given
        distance in order to exclude most of the subarachnoid CSF regions and many GM reagions. The resulting splitting
        of the peaks is easier and the CSF region after the split would include mostly the ventricles.
        This function returns a list of two binary masks in the same shape as the input brain mask. The first includes
        the ventricles while the second includes the soft tissues (i.e. whole brain minus areas with CSF intensities)
        Further important details for finding the splitting intensity:
        - Since the relative location of the CSF and WM peak depend on the chosen MR sequence, a string describing the
        MR sequence needs to be passed as an argument.
        - Since outlier intensities may have excessively large local intensity change values (in particular contrast
        enhanced voxels), a certain percentage of voxels should be excluded as candidates for the splitting intensity
        from both ends of the histogram. That number can be specified.
        - Due to the erosion, the brain mask should not have any holes, because those would be strongly enlarged by the
        erosion. In case of holes (e.g. due to exclusion of ROIs), it is advised to either fill the holes first or to
        not perfrom the erosion.
        - The ventricle mask is obtained by applying the intensity threshold to the eroded brain, so that the outer
        voxels cannot interfere. However, the remaining brain mask (GM, WM) is determined by applying the intensity
        threshold to the entire input brain so as to not exclude the outer regions of the brain.
        - The splitting has shown to be relatively robust to different images and sequences, but may fail for very low
        resolutions and sometimes for FLAIR images where other dark brain regions interfere with the histogram detection
        of the CSF.

        voxel spacing array. Should return an array of the same shape as the intensity array, but with each value
        representing the local intensity change.
        :param histogram_calculation_function: function: takes as input the intensity array and a binary mask. It should
        return a histogram of the intensities inside the mask in the form of a tuple containing an intensity grid
        as the first element and the corresponding frequencies as the second element.
